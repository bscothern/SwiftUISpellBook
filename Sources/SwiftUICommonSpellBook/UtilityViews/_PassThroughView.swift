/// This is an uninhabitable type just like `NeverView` but is seperated out so calls to `fatalViewError()` and uses of this type are different.
/// Without having the seperation you cannot check a generic type against `_PassThroughView` safely.
///
/// - Important:
///     You should not create any function or property that returns this type.
///     It should **only** be used to for generic constraints.
